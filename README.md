A small program to download pictures taken by the Himawari-8 satellite.
Useful for setting your desktop background to current images.

This is a small personal project to learn Haskell. The program is usable but nowhere near perfect.

### Installation

```bash
stack install 
```

### Usage

```bash
himawari8
``` 

For more information use `himawari8 --help`


**Warning:** Running this program removes all .png files from the output directory (for now).
